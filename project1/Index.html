        <p>This brilliant and attractive book makes one of the most influential and lavishly-drawn fencing manuals of
            the Middle Ages available in English for the first time. The authentic fifteenth-century techniques of
            master of arms Hans Talhoffer are illustrated in detail, presenting not only a unique historic record but
            also a visual guide for modern practitioners. Talhoffer's professional fencing manual of 1467
            illustrates
            the intricacies of the medieval art of fighting, covering both the 'judicial duel' (an officially sanctioned
            fight to resolve a legal dispute) and personal combat. Combatants in the Middle Ages used footwork,
            avoidance, and the ability to judge and manipulate timing and distance to exploit and enhance the sword's
            inherent cutting and thrusting capabilities. These skills were supplemented with techniques for
            grappling,
            wrestling, kicking and throwing the opponent, as well as disarming him by seizing his weapon. Every attack
            contained a defense and every defense a counter-attack. Talhoffer reveals the techniques for wrestling,
            unarmored fighting with the long sword, pole-axe, dagger, sword and buckler, and mounted combat. This
            unparalleled guide to medieval combat, illustrated with 268 contemporary images, provides a glimpse of
            real
            people fighting with skill, sophistication and ruthlessness.</p>

            <blockquote>Excellent (and authentic) book on medieval combat - illustrations are vivid and plentiful so
                that
                you
                really understand the brutal nature of combat at this time. <br>Happy to see the revival of European
                forms
                of
                martial arts; glad that there are dedicated practitioners who are passing this knowledge down before it
                is
                lost.
